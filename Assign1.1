1) What are functions in Python?
    A function is a block of code which is executed only when a call is made to the function. def keyword is used to define a particular function as shown below:

    def function():
    print("Hi, Welcome to Intellipaat")
    function(); # call to the function

    Output:
    Hi, Welcome to Intellipaat

2)What are the common built-in data types in Python?
    Python supports the below-mentioned built-in data types:
    Immutable data types:
    Number
    String
    Tuple

    Mutable data types:
    List
    Dictionary
    set
3) What are local variables and global variables in Python?
    Local variable: Any variable declared inside a function is known as Local variable and it’s accessibility remains inside that function only.

    Global Variable: Any variable declared outside the function is known as Global variable and it can be easily accessible by any function present throughout the program.

4) What does [::-1] do?
    [::-1] ,this is an example of slice notation and helps to reverse the sequence with the help of indexing.

    [Start,stop,step count]

5) What does *args and **kwargs mean?
    .*args: It is used to pass multiple arguments in a function.
    **kwargs: It is used to pass multiple keyworded arguments in a function in python.

6) Write a Python program to count the total number of lines in a text file?
    def file_count(fname):
    with open(fname) as f:
    for i, 1 in enumerate(f):
    paas
    return i+1
    print(“Total number of lines in the text file: ”, file_count(“file.txt”))

7) What would be the output if I run the following code block?
    list1 = [2, 33, 222, 14, 25]
    print(list1[-2])
    14
    33
    25
    Error
    Ans. output:14

8) What is the purpose of is, not and in operators?
    Operators are referred to as special functions that take one or more values(operands) and produce a corresponding result.

    is: returns the true value when both the operands are true  (Example: “x” is ‘x’)
    not: returns the inverse of the boolean value based upon the operands (example:”1” returns “0” and vice-versa.
    In: helps to check if the element is present in a given Sequence or not.

9) What is the lambda function in Python?
    A lambda function is an anonymous function (a function that does not have a name) in Python. To define anonymous functions, we use the ‘lambda’ keyword instead of the ‘def’ keyword, hence the name ‘lambda function’. Lambda functions can have any number of arguments but only one statement.

    For example:

    l = lambda x,y : x*y
    print(a(5, 6))

10) What is the difference between append() and extend() methods?
    Both append() and extend() methods are methods used to add elements at the end of a list.

    append(element): Adds the given element at the end of the list that called this append() method
    extend(another-list): Adds the elements of another list at the end of the list that called this extend() method

11) What is docstring in Python?
    Python lets users include a description (or quick notes) for their methods using documentation strings or docstrings. Docstrings are different from regular comments in Python as, rather than being completely ignored by the Python Interpreter like in the case of comments, these are defined within triple quotes.

12) Which one of the following is not the correct syntax for creating a set in Python?
    set([[1,2],[3,4],[4,5]])
    set([1,2,2,3,4,5])
    {1,2,3,4}
    set((1,2,3,4))

    Ans.    set([[1,2],[3,4],[4,5]])
    Explanation: The argument given for the set must be iterable.

13) What is different between List and Tuple?
    Lists and Tuples store one or more objects or values in a specific order. 
    The objects stored in a list or tuple can be of any type including the nothing type defined by the None Keyword.

    The main difference between lists and a tuples is the fact that lists are mutable whereas tuples are immutable.

    Syntax Differences
    Lists are surrounded by square brackets [] and Tuples are surrounded by parenthesis ().

        a= [1,2,3,4]
        b= (1,2,3,4)

    Mutable List vs Immutable Tuples
    List has mutable nature i.e., we can be changed or modified after its creation according to needs whereas tuple has immutable nature i.e., tuple can’t be changed or modified after its creation.

    Remeber 
    The literal syntax of tuples is shown by parentheses () whereas the literal syntax of lists is shown by square brackets [] .
    Lists has variable length, tuple has fixed length.
    List has mutable nature, tuple has immutable nature.
    List has more functionality than the tuple.

14) What is the difference between Python Arrays and lists?
    Arrays in python can only contain elements of same data types i.e., data type of array should be homogeneous. It is a thin wrapper around C language arrays and consumes far less memory than lists.

    Lists in python can contain elements of different data types i.e., data type of lists can be heterogeneous. It has the disadvantage of consuming large memory.

15)What is slicing in Python?
    Ans: Slicing is used to access parts of sequences like lists, tuples, and strings. The syntax of slicing is-[start:end:step]. The step can be omitted as well. When we write [start:end] this returns all the elements of the sequence from the start (inclusive) till the end-1 element. If the start or end element is negative i, it means the ith element from the end. The step indicates the jump or how many elements have to be skipped. Eg. if there is a list- [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]. Then [-1:2:2] will return elements starting from the last element till the third element by printing every second element.i.e. [8,6,4].

16)What does sequence mean and which three types of data fall into this category?
    A sequence data type is a collection of objects ordered by a specific position. In Python, Strings, lists, and tuples are the data types based on sequences. The Sequences share common sequence operations, such as indexing, concatenation, and slicing, but also have type-specific method calls.

17)What does mapping mean and what kind of data type is based on mapping?
    The term mapping refers to an object that maps keys to associated values. The Python dictionary is the only type of mapping in the base typeset. Mappings do not maintain any left-to-right position order; they support access to stored data by key, as well as type-specific method calls.

18) Is indentation necessary in Python?
    Indentation is required in Python if not done properly the code is not executed properly and might throw errors. Indentation is usually done using four space characters.

19)Define a function in Python.
    A block of code that is executed when it is called is defined as a function. The keyword def is used to define a Python function.

20)What is the Pass statement?
    A Pass statement in Python is used when we cannot decide what to do in our code, but we must type something to make it syntactically correct.
